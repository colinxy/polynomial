This module make it easy to manipulate polynomial 
functions. Unlike function object, which can only 
be applied to a value, the Poly class can also add, 
multiply, compute derivative. It can initialized from 
several forms: string form, series starting from 0, 
or a opitimal fit.

I am working on it to enable the polynomial factoring
functionality.
